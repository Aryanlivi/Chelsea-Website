               Chelsea  have been banned from the transfer market for two windows after Fifa found them guilty of a serious and systemic breach of the rules regarding their dealings with overseas players under the age of 18. The club swiftly said they would appeal.
        </p><p>
                The governing body announced the sanction on Friday at the end of a lengthy investigation into Chelsea and how they have registered players at their academy over a number of years.
        </p><p>    
                The Guardian revealed last month that Fifa had looked into more than 100 player cases at Chelsea and it emerged on Friday they had charged them with 92 breaches of article 19 alone – the most serious infringement relating to the registration of minors. Chelsea were found guilty in 29 of those cases.

                The club were also found to have broken other rules, including article 18bis, which concerns third-party influence. Fifa said that Chelsea were guilty “in connection with two agreements it concluded concerning minors and which allowed it to influence other clubs in transfer-related matters”.
        </p><p>
                Chelsea have been fined 600,000 Swiss francs (£460,000) and given 90 days to “regularise the situation of the minor players concerned”, which could involve them being forced to move on anyone brought to the club in contravention of the regulations.
              </p><p>  
                “Chelsea FC categorically refutes [sic] the findings of the Fifa disciplinary committee and will therefore be appealing the decision,” the club said. “Initially, Chelsea FC was charged under Articles 19.1 and 19.3 in relation to 92 players. We welcome the fact that Fifa has accepted that there was no breach in relation to 63 of these players, but the club is extremely disappointed that Fifa has not accepted the club’s submissions in relation to the remaining 29 players. Chelsea FC acted in accordance with the relevant regulations.”
              </p><p> 
                Chelsea ultimately have the right to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport (Cas). It is possible they could delay their punishment until after this summer’s window via appeals, which can be time-consuming, meaning they would be free to make signings between the beginning of June and the end of August.
                
                Fifa has also sanctioned the Football Association for breaching the rules in connection with minors, because player registrations are processed at FA level, imposing a fine of 510,000 Swiss francs (£391,000). Fifa said in its statement that it was allowing the FA “a period of six months to address the situation concerning the international transfer and first registration of minors in football”.
